# Step 1: Build Stage
FROM maven:3.8.4-openjdk-17 AS build

# Set the working directory for the build stage
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the pom.xml first to take advantage of caching
COPY pom.xml .

# Download all dependencies (this helps cache the dependencies)
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline

# Copy the entire project to the build container
COPY . .

# Build the application (skip tests for faster builds)
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests=true

# Step 2: Runtime Stage
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine AS runtime

# Set the working directory for the runtime stage
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file from the build stage to the runtime container
COPY --from=build /app/target/myapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar .

# Expose the port on which the application will run
EXPOSE 8080

# Set environment variables for Java performance tuning
ENV JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx1024m"

# Command to run the application, ensuring JAVA_OPTS is applied
CMD ["sh", "-c", "java $JAVA_OPTS -jar myapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]
